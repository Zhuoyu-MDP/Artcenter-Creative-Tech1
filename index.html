   3) Wood CAD/CAM (now it's called homag-ix)

    #It is a tool to help with digital production, basicly when you finish your appearance and function design, it will automatically generate the parts drawing, assembling drawing, et cetera. #

3 quotes from "Critical Making" and response


'This is particularly true for complex hardware and software solutions  OPEN EVERYTHING that have traditionally been seen to require proprietary and closed development in order to ensure success.‘
 -I think open design is now a design trend that allows transdisciplinary happen, even though we are not such expert in certain fields, we can still integrate our familiar realm with technology we need. 



’why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?‘


-Maybe because in most traditional companies, design and producing are two separate processes and have different department and employees to handle with them. And basically when criticizing about an unreasonable product, most people think it’s the designers’ problem. 




 ‘Note that this is not about replacing or reproducing designers or design expertise.’
 
 -Before I came here, I have been tired of furniture design and I think there is very limited development space for furniture design. Yet my knowledge about furniture design is nearly only technically, and my thoughts has been trapped in settled design process. Now I think there are more possibilities in every industry if we refresh our mind and dive back into what I’ve learned before.
