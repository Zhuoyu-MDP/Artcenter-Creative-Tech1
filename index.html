    <h3>3 quotes from "Critical Making" and response</h3>


    <p>
        'This is particularly true for complex hardware and software solutions  OPEN EVERYTHING that have traditionally been seen to require proprietary and closed development in order to ensure success.‘
        -I think open design is now a design trend that allows transdisciplinary happen, even though we are not such expert in certain fields, we can still integrate our familiar realm with technology we need.
    </p>



    <p>’why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?‘</p>


    <p>
        -Maybe because in most traditional companies, design and producing are two separate processes and have different department and employees to handle with them. And basically when criticizing about an unreasonable product, most people think it’s the designers’ problem.
    </p>



    <p>
        ‘Note that this is not about replacing or reproducing designers or design expertise.’
    </p>
    <p>-Before I came here, I have been tired of furniture design and I think there is very limited development space for furniture design. Yet my knowledge about furniture design is nearly only technically, and my thoughts has been trapped in settled design process. Now I think there are more possibilities in every industry if we refresh our mind and dive back into what I’ve learned before.</p>

        Quotes from 'The hacker hacked'

    </h2>

    <p>
        1.And, arguably, rather than aiming towards some specific reformist end, the hacker spirit is a ‘way of being’, an attitude towards the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here the hacker has a spirit, or it is a kind of spirit, it's not a certain type of people who are expert at computer. 
     
        </p>
    <p>
        I like the way how the author depicts the term, which attracts me to dig into 'hacker', to seek for its history and see how it goes in today's world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, it has been subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, afterall, for most of people, the spirit of hacking is stupid and pointless anyway,</p>
        <p>who cares if it gets gentrified?
    </p>


    <p>
        2.Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next profitable investment.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's kind of disappointing that in this way, we will lose some pioneers and avant-garde piece of art seems to be left out. 
    </p>
    <p>
       It's more important to seek for ways of earning money nowadays, who care about your curiosity? Who have the courage to defie the corporate ambitions?
    </p>


    <p>
        3.Gentrification is a pacification process that takes the wild and puts it in frames. I believe that hacking is the reverse of that, taking the ordered rules of systems and making them fluid and wild again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think the author romanticised it, originally hacker is a 'way of being', it's curious and rebellious, or maybe, it's speculative. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why things have to be in a frame enacted by authorities? What if they are not?

        3 quotes
    </h2>

    <p>
        1. Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right, art is about expressing insights, aesthetics or any other values in an ingenious way.  For most of the time it has to abstract the foremost element and amplify it, and it require encouragement to abandon relatively unrelated component, even if it looks pretty. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2.This example shows that prototypes are not neces- sarily self-explanatory.  What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prototype is not only about the project itself, it is also about how we interact with it, and it is not only about how designers interact with the object, but also about predict how audience would like to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
       3. The story is told in great detail, and it is clear that many decisions were made about what to emphasize in the role.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we are so used to the navigators on the internet, we take it for granted and just neglect what its role is in our ‘reality’. And this kind of design is exactly my pursuit, to make the interaction happen very naturally.

        1. We were not primarily concerned with technical practicalities at this stage, as we were satisfied that a number of possible routes existed to realise each of the proposals. Instead, we focused on using appropriate, often low-tech, means to simulate and test the experiences the proposals would engender – their aesthetics, their social effects, and their cultural implications – with the older people in the three communities.
    </p>

    <p>
        These experiments are all successful considering the two vital elements of prototype - role, look and feel.
    </p>
        2. People didn’t participate in the experiment simply because they were unaware that the experiment was going on.
    <p>
        I wonder if we should acknowledge that our experiment is an ‘experiment’ to the passer-by rather than let them act spontaneously or unconsciously. And maybe it is their unawareness that post the essential question to refine the interaction. Once I made a project that used an iPad as an AR device, but it seems that if we don’t tell the audience to use this iPad, nobody would pick it up, they just stared at the installation, comment that this is a lovely photography work. 
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We began to realise that the best slogans were slightly ambiguous or detached in tone (‘I am from another country’), or were particular and personal statements (‘I like a few drinks once in a while’). These seemed to escape classification into known forms of public display, invoking curiosity and imagination rather than immediate dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Could there be more effective ways of protest other than holding some plain board with slogans on it. Parade is indeed a spectacle, but this kind of rebellion is probably only mundane in their enemy’s eyes. So, is there any possibility that relatively obscure images or other forms will be more notable propaganda？

        Cityscapes flit past in what appears to be a subway or elevated train window. As we stand in the exhibition space, we can feel the jostling cadence of travel, watching one city (Tokyo) morph seamlessly into another (New York) and then another (Paris). Threaded together, we experience, what technology offers us on a daily basis, closing impossible distances in milliseconds.

        For Kapoor, a work of art doesn’t exist alone but through its viewer. The visitors at Versailles were witness to the dualities of the artist’s work: heaven and earth, visible and invisible, inside and outside, shadow and light. This universe can be read through experience and imagination.
