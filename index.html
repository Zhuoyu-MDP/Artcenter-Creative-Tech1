        3 Quotes from The Electronic as Post-optimal Object & Radical Technologies
    </h2>
    <p>
        1."Every symphony has its compact disc; every audio experience its loud- speaker; every visual image its camera and video disc. Behind every outward image or symbol lies mechanical support, and if the immateriality of these images and symbols gives rise to a new approach to the relationship between human being and object, the analysis will be one of the individual’s connection with the material support underlying the new culture of immateriality”
    </p>
    <p>
        Is data a kind of material? Today nearly everything could be stored online through data, does this internet of things change the presence of materials? This saying was from 1995, at that time people might not think about what if everything could be connected via network, but what about now? What about the future? Is it possible that something which used to be physical only remains digital?
    </p>
    <p>
        2. "These latent indicators of biological performance, otherwise so hard to discern, are made legible in order that they may be rendered subject to the exercise of will, and brought under at least some semblance of control."
    </p>
    <p>
        Internet of things indicates human’s desire for controlling everything surround them. But will this legibility of any statistic of our body lead up to deeper anxiety for the wellbeing? Are these datas in reverse controlling ourselves? Think about an ultimate situation that if plentiful enough datas are collected, machine can precisely project one’s length of lifetime, will that count down of remaining life be a trap for people to prefer to do things which may extend their life rather than more meaningful things for human race?
    </p>
    <p>
       3. "You get your detergent on time, yes, but Amazon gets so much more."
    </p>
    <p>
        This demonstrate the multiple roles of consumers to companies in the chain of industry, which are the resource of fund, as well as samples of statistics for more profit. Through internet of things, the company can get any data they need related to sales in detail. Does network reduce the distance between people or bring them closer to capitalism?

            3 quotes from "Synthetic Psychology"
        </h2>
        <p>
           1.  “But, you will say, this is ridiculous: knowledge implies a flow of information from the environment into a living being or at least into something like a living being. There was no such transmission of information here. We were just playing with sensors, motors, and connections: the properties that happened to emerge may look like knowledge but really are not. We should be careful with such words.”
        </p>
        <p>
            This is like another illustration of human ‘teaching’ a machine/ machine learning. It’s like machine’s expressive potential in relation to the body. We expect machines to actually learn something from human, but the only thing we’ve done is to input information about appearance of behavior, we were just playing with some data, some code, some interfaces which make a machine seem to act like ‘learning’ simultaneously. 
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
            
            2. “You would almost be tempted to say: where decisions are being made, there must be a WILL to make them. Why not? For all we know, this is not the worst criterion for establishing the existence of free will”
    
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a sensor to control a servo is like a simulation of a creature’s awareness of its surroundings and take action.  When it’s in the station of “delay”, it’s thinking and taking a break. But who owns the WILL? Human infuse their will to the machine through commands and let it operate, which creates an illusion that the machine have its own will.
        </p>
        <p>
        </p>
        <p>
           3.  "They were, up to now, of two very simple kinds: the more the sensor was excited, the faster the corresponding motor ran, or, alternatively, the more the sensor was excited. the slower the motor ran. We did not care what the rules of the dependence were, as long as they were of the nature “the more, the more” or “the more. the less.” 
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes we think only human knows that things are rarely “black and white”, and machines are not able to tell what is good and what is bad, they only know the value, the size of the figure. But they are now quite similar with infants, adults implant ideas and values to their next generation. How about the machines? “Like father, like son” Who make decisions on algorithm is crucial to cultivate machine’s point of view.

            Quotes from "What is Code?"
        </h2>
        <p>
            1.	When you use computers too much—which is to say a typical amount—they start to change you. I’ve had Photoshop dreams, Visio dreams, spreadsheet dreams, and Web browser dreams. The dreamscape becomes fluid and can be sorted and restructured. I’ve had programming dreams where I move text around the screen.
        </p> 
    
        <p>
            It’s obvious that computers change us in every aspect of daily life, but I haven’t thought about how they change us in a subconsciousness way. I’ve had dreams where I communicate with others through typing in social media. Once I dreamed about my mom sitting in front of a computer, floating in space, out of my touch. Computers serve as an inextricable knot among people’s relationship, coexists with other images which have a strong influence on our emotion.
        </p> 
        
        <p>
            2.	If you can sell the software, if you can light up the screen, you’re selling infinitely reproducible nothings. The margins on nothing are great—until other people start selling even cheaper nothings or giving them away.
        </p> 
    
        <p>
            What are nothings? Is duplication of softwares nothing? Is the process of duplication nothing? Are repeated texts nothing? Is the repetition of algorithm nothing? Is anything intangible nothing? Aren't dozens of printings of one script nothing? Isn't mass production of the same commodities nothing? Isn't repetition of the same behavior of a labor nothing?
        </p> 
    
        <p>
            3.	The greatest commercial insight of the technology industry is that if you control a computing environment, you can move the market. You can change the way people do things, the way they listen to music, watch videos, and respond to advertising. 
        </p> 
        <p>
            Isn't that great! Nothing will stop us from work since online conference break through the restriction of distance. To demonstrate our support of our favorite pop star, we can pay for Eminem's new album; to satisfy our curiosity and show our enthusiasm, we would order the latest episode of a soap opera, even if we're already a VIP of that platform. Come on, it doesn't cost that much, several bucks for each, just enjoy the reproducible nothings in this internet world!

            For Kapoor, a work of art doesn’t exist alone but through its viewer. The visitors at Versailles were witness to the dualities of the artist’s work: heaven and earth, visible and invisible, inside and outside, shadow and light. This universe can be read through experience and imagination.

        1. We were not primarily concerned with technical practicalities at this stage, as we were satisfied that a number of possible routes existed to realise each of the proposals. Instead, we focused on using appropriate, often low-tech, means to simulate and test the experiences the proposals would engender – their aesthetics, their social effects, and their cultural implications – with the older people in the three communities.
    </p>

    <p>
        These experiments are all successful considering the two vital elements of prototype - role, look and feel.
    </p>
        2. People didn’t participate in the experiment simply because they were unaware that the experiment was going on.
    <p>
        I wonder if we should acknowledge that our experiment is an ‘experiment’ to the passer-by rather than let them act spontaneously or unconsciously. And maybe it is their unawareness that post the essential question to refine the interaction. Once I made a project that used an iPad as an AR device, but it seems that if we don’t tell the audience to use this iPad, nobody would pick it up, they just stared at the installation, comment that this is a lovely photography work. 
    </p>
    <p>
      3. We began to realise that the best slogans were slightly ambiguous or detached in tone (‘I am from another country’), or were particular and personal statements (‘I like a few drinks once in a while’). These seemed to escape classification into known forms of public display, invoking curiosity and imagination rather than immediate dismissal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Could there be more effective ways of protest other than holding some plain board with slogans on it. Parade is indeed a spectacle, but this kind of rebellion is probably only mundane in their enemy’s eyes. So, is there any possibility that relatively obscure images or other forms will be more notable propaganda？

    <p>
        1. Choosing the right kind of more focused prototype to build is an art in itself, and communicating its limited purposes to its various audiences is a critical aspect of its use.
    </p>
    <p>
        Right, art is about expressing insights, aesthetics or any other values in an ingenious way.  For most of the time it has to abstract the foremost element and amplify it, and it require encouragement to abandon relatively unrelated component, even if it looks pretty. 
    </p>
    <p>
        2.This example shows that prototypes are not neces- sarily self-explanatory.  What is significant is not what media or tools were are used to create them, but how they are used by a designer to explore or demonstrate some aspect of the future artifact.
    </p>
    <p>
        Prototype is not only about the project itself, it is also about how we interact with it, and it is not only about how designers interact with the object, but also about predict how audience would like to use it.
    </p>
    <p>
       3. The story is told in great detail, and it is clear that many decisions were made about what to emphasize in the role.
    </p>
    <p>
        Now we are so used to the navigators on the internet, we take it for granted and just neglect what its role is in our ‘reality’. And this kind of design is exactly my pursuit, to make the interaction happen very naturally.

        Quotes from 'The hacker hacked'

    </h2>

    <p>
        1.And, arguably, rather than aiming towards some specific reformist end, the hacker spirit is a ‘way of being’, an attitude towards the world. Here the hacker has a spirit, or it is a kind of spirit, it's not a certain type of people who are expert at computer. I like the way how the author depicts the term, which attracts me to dig into 'hacker', to seek for its history and see how it goes in today's world. Unfortunately, it has been subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, afterall, for most of people, the spirit of hacking is stupid and pointless anyway,</p>who cares if it gets gentrified?
    </p>


    <p>
        2.Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next profitable investment.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's kind of disappointing that in this way, we will lose some pioneers and avant-garde piece of art seems to be left out.  It's more important to seek for ways of earning money nowadays, who care about your curiosity? Who have the courage to defie the corporate ambitions?
    </p>


    <p>
        3.Gentrification is a pacification process that takes the wild and puts it in frames. I believe that hacking is the reverse of that, taking the ordered rules of systems and making them fluid and wild again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think the author romanticised it, originally hacker is a 'way of being', it's curious and rebellious, or maybe, it's speculative.  Why things have to be in a frame enacted by authorities? What if they are not?

    <h3>3 quotes from "Critical Making" and response</h3>


    <p>
        'This is particularly true for complex hardware and software solutions  OPEN EVERYTHING that have traditionally been seen to require proprietary and closed development in order to ensure success.‘
        -I think open design is now a design trend that allows transdisciplinary happen, even though we are not such expert in certain fields, we can still integrate our familiar realm with technology we need.
    </p>



    <p>’why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?‘</p>


    <p>
        -Maybe because in most traditional companies, design and producing are two separate processes and have different department and employees to handle with them. And basically when criticizing about an unreasonable product, most people think it’s the designers’ problem.
    </p>



    <p>
        ‘Note that this is not about replacing or reproducing designers or design expertise.’
    </p>
    <p>-Before I came here, I have been tired of furniture design and I think there is very limited development space for furniture design. Yet my knowledge about furniture design is nearly only technically, and my thoughts has been trapped in settled design process. Now I think there are more possibilities in every industry if we refresh our mind and dive back into what I’ve learned before.</p>
