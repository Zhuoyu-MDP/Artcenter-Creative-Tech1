    <h3>3 quotes from "Critical Making" and response</h3>


    <p>
        'This is particularly true for complex hardware and software solutions  OPEN EVERYTHING that have traditionally been seen to require proprietary and closed development in order to ensure success.‘
        -I think open design is now a design trend that allows transdisciplinary happen, even though we are not such expert in certain fields, we can still integrate our familiar realm with technology we need.
    </p>



    <p>’why in fact does ‘critical thinking’ seem such a common-sense term, while ‘critical making’ seems odd to most of us?‘</p>


    <p>
        -Maybe because in most traditional companies, design and producing are two separate processes and have different department and employees to handle with them. And basically when criticizing about an unreasonable product, most people think it’s the designers’ problem.
    </p>



    <p>
        ‘Note that this is not about replacing or reproducing designers or design expertise.’
    </p>
    <p>-Before I came here, I have been tired of furniture design and I think there is very limited development space for furniture design. Yet my knowledge about furniture design is nearly only technically, and my thoughts has been trapped in settled design process. Now I think there are more possibilities in every industry if we refresh our mind and dive back into what I’ve learned before.</p>

        Quotes from 'The hacker hacked'

    </h2>

    <p>
        1.And, arguably, rather than aiming towards some specific reformist end, the hacker spirit is a ‘way of being’, an attitude towards the world.
    </p>

    <p>
        Here the hacker has a spirit, or it is a kind of spirit, it's not a certain type of people who are expert at computer. 
     
        </p>
    <p>
        I like the way how the author depicts the term, which attracts me to dig into 'hacker', to seek for its history and see how it goes in today's world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Unfortunately, it has been subsumed into the ideology of solutionism, afterall, for most of people, the spirit of hacking is stupid and pointless anyway,</p>
        <p>who cares if it gets gentrified?
    </p>


    <p>
        2.Maybe the hackers – like the disenchanted artists and hipsters – are just the vanguard charged with identifying the next profitable investment.
    </p>

    <p>
        It's kind of disappointing that in this way, we will lose some pioneers and avant-garde piece of art seems to be left out. 
    </p>
    <p>
       It's more important to seek for ways of earning money nowadays, who care about your curiosity? Who have the courage to defie the corporate ambitions?
    </p>


    <p>
        3.Gentrification is a pacification process that takes the wild and puts it in frames. I believe that hacking is the reverse of that, taking the ordered rules of systems and making them fluid and wild again.
    </p>
    <p>
        I don't think the author romanticised it, originally hacker is a 'way of being', it's curious and rebellious, or maybe, it's speculative. 
    </p>
    <p>
        Why things have to be in a frame enacted by authorities? What if they are not?
